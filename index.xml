      <description>Overview Mask wearing is a simple and powerful way to combat COVID, but it is most effective when practiced at scale within populations. Unfortunately mask wearing has become politicized in the United States, and businesses are often in the position of policing and enforcing mask wearing themselves.
Enter the COVID Bouncer - an application which can be used to detect mask wearing without needing to put a real person at risk of exposure.</description>

      <description>In 2019 I began to replace services that I use and which use my data with services I can host on a personal Virtual Private Server, and have complete control of the data. In 2020 I went through a migration from Traefik 1.7 to 2.3, and took the opportunity to completely revamp my self hosting approach, applications, best practices, security, and more. I&amp;rsquo;m hosting everything on a Contabo VPS and on a local Raspberry Pi.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a project or two in progress, many of which I work through by following guides and walkthroughs posted by others.
I created this site with the intention of documenting what I work on, and to provide additional guidance for others which may be interested in building on it.</description>
