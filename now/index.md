# Now


Here's what I'm working on now:

### AI / Data Science
* I'm attending more Data Science and AI meetups in the Austin area, if you have one you like [reach out](https://pierce.xyz/@eric)
* Planning writeups on applications of transfer learning with Stable Diffusion, running LLMs locally, and personal data EDA

### Self Hosting
* I moved all my notes from a self-hosted [Standardnotes](https://github.com/standardnotes/server) instance, to Obsidian using remotely-sync and Nextcloud
* I recently started digitizing and locally hosting all documents with [Paperless-ngx](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx) and my health data with [Fasten Health](https://github.com/fastenhealth/fasten-onprem)

### Life
* I'm enjoying a full live music calendar both in Austin and across the US
* I'm engaged and planning my wedding for 2024!
