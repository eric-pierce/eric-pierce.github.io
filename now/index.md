# Now


Here's what I'm working on now:

* I recently marked my first full year in Austin, TX and I'm finding new local communities to join
* I'm very excited to have a full live music agenda again for the first time in the past few years
* Looking into self-hosting my podcasts and audiobooks and moving away from Apple Podcasts and Audible
* Playing around with applications of some of the new Stable Diffusion models
* Trying to get more experience directly working with earth observation data and new applications
