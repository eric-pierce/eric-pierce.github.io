# Now


Here's what I'm working on now:

* Just installed Carplay on the OEM hardware of an unsupported Toyota Prius (writeup coming soon)
* I just moved to Austin, TX and am getting familiar with the community
* Earlier this year I finished my Master's of Data Science at Northwestern, which I've been doing on nights/weekends for the past three years
* Working through LeetCode questions
