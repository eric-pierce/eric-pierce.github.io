# About


I founded and lead the Solutions Architecture practice for Epsilon's Digital Arm, and am excited to get back to traveling.

I always have a project or two in progress, many of which I work through by following guides and walkthroughs posted by others. I created this site with the intention of documenting what I work on, and to provide additional guidance for others which may be interested in building on them.

To see what I'm working on, check out my [Now page](../now/).
