    "body": "In 2019 I began to replace services that I use and which use my data with services I can host on a personal Virtual Private Server, and have complete control of the data. In 2020 I went through a migration from Traefik 1.7 to 2.3, and took the opportunity to completely revamp my self hosting approach, applications, best practices, security, and more. I\u0026rsquo;m hosting everything on a Contabo VPS and on a local Raspberry Pi.\nLocal Raspberry Pi\n Unbound - Local recursive DNS resolver PiHole - DNS black hole Wireguard (PiVPN) - VPN Access through PiVPN  I bought several cheap Wyze 2.0 Cameras and put the DaFang custom firmware on them this lets me VPN into my home network and connect to network streams from the cameras using VLC on my phone. I have motion detection notifications running through Telegram with stills taken when motion is detected\nContabo VPS - 9 Euro per month, 6 Cores, 16GB Ram, 400GB Storage (SSD)\nAs part of my security updates, I decided that some services I host had no business being externally accessible, even when they\u0026rsquo;re behind HTTP authentication. I set up wireguard docker image to allow me to access my VPS over VPN, and then modified wireguard\u0026rsquo;s Coredns to allow me to access the services I want on the domains I would have previously accessed externally. I followed this guide for that.\nOther security updates include moving to official images for everything, leveraging Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s proxy service for any web based applications (though some may argue this isn\u0026rsquo;t as good for privacy), and moving to docker secrets where possible\nI also moved to a socket proxy for the docker socket rather than allowing any images (except for the socket proxy itself) direct access to the docker socket.\nEverything except fail2ban on my Contabo VPS are sourced from docker images.\nWeb Applications hosted behind Wireguard VPN\n Portainer - Docker Management PhpMyAdmin - Management of a MariaDB database for applications which don\u0026rsquo;t support Postgres PgAdmin - Management of a Postgres database for any applications which do support Postgres Redis Commander - for managing my Redis Memcache installation to speed up Nextcloud  Non-Open-web accessible applications\n Docker Socket Proxy - This allows applications to access only the services they need from the socket proxy and nothing else Watchtower - Docker image updates, used as Ouroborus is no longer actively updated MariaDB - Open source MySQL server for applications which don\u0026rsquo;t support my preferred SQL server, Postgres Postgres - Open source SQL server for applications which it Redis - Memcache to speed up Nextcloud  Open-web accessible applications\n Traefik 2.3 - used for reverse proxying open-web applications Firefox Syncserver (MariaDB) - this is in the process of being moved to Rust, but that image isn\u0026rsquo;t ready yet. Still using the old python 2.7 version to sync browser settings, extension lists, and bookmarks Wallabag (MariaDB) - Pocket replacement, this integrates very well with iOS and allows me to \u0026ldquo;stash\u0026rdquo; anything I come across on twitter, reddit, browsing, and more. I also have Wallabag set up as an RSS feed so when I stash something it shows up in my RSS reader Nextcloud (Postgres) - primarily used as Google replacement, and I use it for Contacts, Calendar, Google Drive, and Tasks/ToDo hosting Nextcloud-Cron - the same Nextcloud image but manages the \u0026ldquo;maintenance\u0026rdquo; jobs for Nextcloud without needing to schedule cron jobs on the host Wireguard - allows me to access internal services via VPN. This is one of the few \u0026ldquo;unofficial\u0026rdquo; images as I don\u0026rsquo;t think wireguard hosts an official one Tiny-Tiny-RSS (Postgres) - Last year the developer created official docker images, so I moved from an unofficially maintained one to the official ones. This consists of a backend and frontend component, as well as an updater cron job. I much prefer this approach as the unofficial image wasn\u0026rsquo;t static, and was just an older docker image that pulled the latest version of the app from Git. Bitwarden_rs (Postgres) - This is the unofficial bitwarden api/backend/frontend implementation in Rust. I moved from the default sqlite backend to a postgres backend and found that it is now much speedier when updating folders Standardnotes Sync Server - This is the official backend for standardnotes. I looked at the Go implementation as well (standardfile) but already had this running so didn\u0026rsquo;t switch over. This is a new service for me as I was using the Nextcloud Notes before, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t happy with the mobile app experience (manual sync over webdav in the Notebooks app). The official iOS app is just as seamless as the native iPhone notes app. Standardnotes Web App - the web frontend for standardnotes Standardnotes Extensions - This is a docker image which contains all the open source extensions for standardnotes. It\u0026rsquo;s very simple to run, and lets you use several high powered extensions all self-hosted  Services I\u0026rsquo;m working on adding now:\n Some kind of backup solution - I was looking at Volumerize for encrypted backups to my rsync.net account, but it appears that the repo is going to be deprecated at some point in the near future  Services I\u0026rsquo;m considering adding in the future:\n Authelia SSO Bookstack Apache Guacamole Papermerge Monica CRM fail2ban - may move it into a container  ",
